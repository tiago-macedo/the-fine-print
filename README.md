## FAQ

* Some of the characters I type don't get converted!

[Unicode is a mess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts). It has some subscript and superscript forms of characters, but lacks others. There is, for example, no Unicode letter q in either form. Also, I have yet to include Greek letters. Let me know if that's a frequent use case.
